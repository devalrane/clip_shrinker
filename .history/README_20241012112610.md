# Clip Shrinker

A Python GUI to upload large video files and compress them to save space and allow social media sharing (WhatsApp).

This started as a project to allow my friends and I to share clips (size > 500MB) on Whatsapp (sharing size limit ~100 MB) taken during late night Valorant sessions.
